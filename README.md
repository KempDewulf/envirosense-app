# EnviroSense App

EnviroSense is a Flutter application designed to manage and monitor home devices, providing real-time environmental insights and control.

## Key Features

- **Device Scanning and Configuration**: Manage device settings through the DeviceControlsTab.
- **Room-based Device Assignment**: Assign devices to rooms using the AddDeviceScreen.
- **Caching and Clearing Options**: Manage cache and stored data with database_service and ClearCacheOptionsSheet.
- **Authentication**: Implemented using FirebaseAuth for secure sign-in and registration.
- **Real-time Notifications**: Receive instant notifications for device activities and alerts.
- **Multilingual Support**: Switch between English, French, and Dutch languages throughout the app with persistent language preferences.

## Architecture

EnviroSense follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern to separate concerns and improve code maintainability.

- **Model**: Represents the data layer, including data structures and business logic. Models are located in the `lib/data/models/` directory.
- **View**: Represents the UI layer, including widgets and layouts. Views are located in the `lib/presentation/views/` directory.
- **Controller**: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and View, handling user input and updating the View. Controllers are located in the `lib/presentation/controllers/` directory.

### Implementation

1. **Models**: Define data structures and business logic. For example, `DeviceModel` represents a device with properties like `id`, `name`, and `status`.
2. **Views**: Create UI components using Flutter widgets. For example, `DeviceListView` displays a list of devices.
3. **Controllers**: Handle user interactions and update the View. For example, `DeviceController` manages device-related actions like adding or removing devices.

By following the MVC pattern, we ensure a clear separation of concerns, making the codebase easier to understand, test, and maintain.

## Project Structure

- **lib/**: Contains the main Dart code, widgets, controllers, and UI layouts.
- **android/**: Hosts Android-specific files like the AndroidManifest.xml, Gradle configs, and Kotlin entry points.
- **ios/**: Contains iOS-specific implementations including the AppDelegate.swift and Xcode project configuration.
- **linux/**: Holds Linux platform code and the custom GApplication-based entry point.
- **windows/**: Contains Windows platform code and configurations.
- **macos/**: Contains macOS platform code and configurations.

## Packages

EnviroSense uses several packages to enhance its functionality. Below is an overview of the key packages and their purposes:

- **firebase_core**: Required for initializing Firebase in the Flutter app.
- **firebase_auth**: Provides authentication features, allowing users to sign in and register securely.
- **firebase_messaging**: Enables real-time notifications for device activities and alerts.
- **connectivity_plus**: Used to check the network connectivity status of the device.
- **shared_preferences**: Allows storing simple data persistently across app launches.
- **sqflite**: Provides SQLite database support for local data storage.
- **flutter_dotenv**: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file, useful for managing configuration settings.
- **google_fonts**: Allows using Google Fonts in the app for a consistent and attractive typography.
- **logging**: Provides logging capabilities to help with debugging and monitoring the app's behavior.
- **country-flags**: This package provides access to country flags as image assets.
- **provider**: Provider is a state management solution for Flutter. It simplifies the way data is passed through the widget tree and ensures efficient updates when the data changes.
- **intl**: The intl package is used for internationalization and localization.
- **flutter_localizations**: This package is part of the Flutter SDK and supports app localization by providing localized text, dates, and other resources. It integrates with the intl package and enables apps to adapt to different languages and regions automatically.

These packages are essential for implementing the core features of EnviroSense, such as authentication, real-time notifications, data storage, and network connectivity checks.

## APIs

EnviroSense interacts with several APIs to provide its functionality. Below is an overview of the key APIs used:

- **Deno Server REST API**: This custom REST API is used for managing and controlling home devices. It provides endpoints for device data & configuration, status updates, and other device-related operations.
    - The OpenAPI documentation can be seen [here](http://94.130.75.173:8101/)
- **Weather REST API**: This REST API is used to fetch real-time weather data, which is integrated into the app to provide environmental insights. The weather data includes temperature, humidity, and other relevant metrics.
    - We use [weatherapi.com](weatherapi.com)

## Firebase Configuration

Ensure you have the correct Firebase configuration files in place:
- `android/app/google-services.json`
- `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`

## Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project by copying the `.env.example` file:
```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Replace the placeholder values with your actual values.

## Setup Instructions

1. Ensure Flutter and Dart tools are installed.
2. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:KempDewulf/envirosense-app.git
    cd flutter-app
    ```
3. Run `flutter pub get` to fetch all declared dependencies.
4. Run `flutter doctor` to make sure flutter can run on the desired platform (e.g. web, ios, macos, windows, android).
5. Execute `flutter run` to build and launch the app on the desired platform.
